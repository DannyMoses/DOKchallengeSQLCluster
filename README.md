# Welcome

This is my submission for the DigitalOcean Kubernetes Challenge, which involves
using DigitalOcean's Kubernetes services to complete a project. This was a 
great way for me to finally learn how to use Kubernetes as well as a great 
introduction to Terraform.

# Project

I chose to try out the Deploy a Scalable SQL Cluster challenge. 

The requirements are:
- Redundancy
- Scalable(I chose to use horizontal scaling)

## First Steps

- I didn't even know how to provision a Kubernetes cluster at first so I first
followed the steps on how to do that from one of the excellent 
[presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCv6dRjtgHI) at the 
DigitalOcean Deploy Conference.
